# Scraping configuration for Substack "For You" feed

sources:
  # Substack "For You" Feed
  # This is the algorithmic feed at https://substack.com/home
  substack:
    - url: "https://substack.com/home"
      name: "Substack For You Feed"
      requires_auth: true
      posts_to_scrape: 40
      scrape_type: "feed"  # Scroll through feed, not individual RSS

# Notes:
# - Substack requires authentication (login on first run)
# - Playwright scrolls through the actual feed to load posts
# - Articles may be re-evaluated across runs (no "last seen" tracking)
# - If you see too many repeats, reduce posts_to_scrape
# - Scraping 40 Substack posts takes ~30-60 seconds
#
# Twitter/X has been removed from scope:
# - Twitter actively blocks Playwright automation
# - Would require paid API access ($100+/month) to implement
