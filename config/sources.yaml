# Scraping configuration for Substack "For You" feed and Twitter timeline

sources:
  # Substack "For You" Feed
  # This is the algorithmic feed at https://substack.com/home
  substack:
    - url: "https://substack.com/home"
      name: "Substack For You Feed"
      requires_auth: true
      posts_to_scrape: 40
      scrape_type: "feed"  # Scroll through feed, not individual RSS

  # Twitter/X Timeline
  # Home timeline with posts from followed accounts and lists
  twitter:
    - url: "https://twitter.com/home"
      name: "Twitter Home Timeline"
      requires_auth: true
      posts_to_scrape: 100
      scrape_type: "timeline"  # Scroll through timeline

# Notes:
# - Both sources require authentication (login on first run)
# - Playwright will scroll through the actual feeds to load posts
# - No "last seen" tracking - articles may be re-evaluated across runs
# - If you see too many repeats, reduce posts_to_scrape
# - Scraping 40 Substack posts + 100 tweets takes ~2-3 minutes
