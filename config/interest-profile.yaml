# Deep questions I'm actively exploring
# Prioritize articles that address these directly
questions:
  - "What does it mean to use technology 'skillfully'?"
  - "How could individuals rethink their relationship with technology from the ground up, being more intentional about cost:benefit tradeoffs? How do we diagnose and address current problems in our consumption?"
  - "How do we craft new technology that explicitly enables human flourishing? And can we use experimentation to get there?"
  - "What are the overlaps between mindfulness/spiritual development and technology? How might mindfulness help us use technology more intentionally? And how might technology support or accelerate spiritual development?"
  - "What meditative practices will help me most efficiently and effectively develop the skills of concentration, sensory clarity, and equanimity?"
  - "How do I bring mindfulness plus Buddhist ethics into different aspects of daily life? How do I best 'show up'?"
  - "What does it mean to 'grow up' and 'clean up' in addition to 'waking up'? What is the work required?"
  - "How do I continue to improve my ability to formulate, communicate, and collaborate on ideas via writing and speaking?"
  - "How might AI contribute to the 'end of the knowledge economy', and what could a new emergent 'wisdom economy' look like?"
  - "In what ways does writing parallel or overlap with spiritual practice?"
  - "What is the most efficient and effective 80/20 approach to physical health and longevity?"
